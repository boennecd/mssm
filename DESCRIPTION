Description: Provides methods to perform parameter estimation and 
  make analysis of multivariate observed outcomes through time which depends 
  on a latent state variable. All methods scale well in the dimension 
  of the observed outcomes at each time point. The package contains an 
  implementation of a Laplace approximation, particle filters like 
  suggested by Lin, Zhang, Cheng, & Chen (2005)
  <doi:10.1198/016214505000000349>, and the gradient and observed information
  matrix approximation suggested by Poyiadjis, Doucet, & Singh (2011) 
  <doi:10.1093/biomet/asq062>.
